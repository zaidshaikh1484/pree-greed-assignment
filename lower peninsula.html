<h1>Lower Peninsula of Michigan </h1>


<ol>
<li> The Lower Peninsula of Michigan, also known as Lower Michigan, is the larger, southern and less-elevated of<br>
	the two major landmasses that make up the U.S. state of Michigan. </li><br>
<li> Although the Upper Peninsula is commonly referred to as the U.P., it is uncommon for the Lower Peninsula to be called the L.P.<br>
	Because of its recognizable shape, the Lower Peninsula is nicknamed The Mitten,<br>
	with the eastern region identified as The Thumb. 	</li><br>
	
<li>The peninsula is sometimes divided into the Northern Lower Peninsula—which is more sparsely populated and largely forested—and <br>
	the Southern Lower Peninsula—which is largely urban or farmland. Southern Lower Michigan is sometimes further divided <br>
	into economic and cultural subregions.	</li><br>

</ol>
<h1>Geography</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Lower Peninsula is bounded on the west by Lake Michigan and on the northeast by Lake Huron, which connect at the Straits of Mackinac.</li><br>
<li> In the southeast, the waterway consisting of the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Detroit River, and Lake Erie separates it from the province of Ontario, Canada. <br>
	It is bounded on the south by the states of Indiana and Ohio. </li><br>
<li>At its widest points, the peninsula is 277 miles (446 km) long from north to south and 195 miles (314 km) from east to west.<br>
	It contains nearly two-thirds of Michigan's total land area. The surface of the peninsula is generally level,<br>
	broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall, most common in the north</li><br>



</ul>

<h1>Regions</h1>
<ol>
<li>The peninsula can be divided into four main regions based on geological and geographical differences;<br>
	the amount of urban areas or rural areas; minority populations; and agriculture. </li><br>
<li>The four principal regions listed below can further be separated into sub-regions and overlapping areas:</li><br>
<li>Northern Michigan
	Central or Mid-Michigan
	The Thumb
	Tri-Cities
	Southern Michigan
	West Michigan
	Southern Michigan
	Michiana
	Southeast Michigan
	Metro Detroit
