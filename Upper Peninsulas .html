<ol>
<li>The Upper Peninsula of Michigan—also known as Upper Michigan <br>
    or colloquially the U.P. or Yoop—is the northern and more elevated of <br>the two major landmasses that make up the U.S. state of Michigan</li><br>
<li> First inhabited by Algonquian-speaking native American tribes, the area was explored by French colonists,<br>
	then occupied by British forces, before being ceded to the newly established United States in the late 18th century. </li>	<br>
<li> The Upper Peninsula contains 29% of the land area of Michigan and has 3% of its total population; at the height of the mining and <br>
	timber era in the early 20th century it had as much as 11% of the state's population.</li> <br>

<h1> History </h1>
<ul>

<li>The first known inhabitants of the Upper Peninsula were tribes speaking Algonquian languages,<br>
	specifically the Algonquian branches of Ojibwe and Menominee. They arrived roughly around 800 C.E.<br>
	and subsisted chiefly from fishing. Early tribes included the Menominee, Odawa, Ojibwe, Nocquet, and Potawatomi</li>.<br>

<li>Étienne Brûlé, an explorer and Catholic missionary working on behalf of the colony of New France under <br>
	the tutelage of fellow explorer Samuel de Champlain, was the first known European to visit the peninsula </li><br>

<li>By 1680, the major Ojibwe communities on the peninsula were in the Sault, L’Anse, and on Grand Island.</li>

<h1>Geography</h1>
<ol>
<li>Including extensive parts of the Great Lakes, the Upper Peninsula contains about 36,139 square miles <br>
	(93,600 km2) of total area. Of that, about 16,378 square miles (42,420 km2) is its land area about 29% of the state</li><br>

<li>It is bounded on the north by Lake Superior, on the east by St. Marys River, on the south by the Niagara Escarpment<br>
	Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and on the west by Wisconsin and (counting the water border on Lake Superior) by Minnesota.</li><br>	

<li>Michigan's Upper Peninsula is bounded on land by Wisconsin to the southwest and west; and in territorial waters by Minnesota to the west,<br>
	Ontario to the west, north and east, and the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin extends into Lake Michigan east of the western Upper Peninsula.</li>
